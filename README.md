# Hi, I'm Konstantin Tarkus

### Principal Software Engineer & OSS Architect

**I build AI-first systems and the boring-but-critical plumbing that keeps them alive.**

### ⚡ The TL;DR

I specialize in **AI Infrastructure, Developer Experience (DX), and 0-to-1 Architecture**. I design systems that don't wake you up at 2am—resilient queues, clean API gateways, and observability that actually works.

Based in **Porto San Giorgio, Italy (CET)**.
*Working remotely with US/UK teams since 2014. My mornings are your "while you were sleeping" deep work blocks.*

### 📦 Open Source & Architecture

I don't just use tools; I build the "paved roads" for other engineers.

| Project | Role | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [**React Starter Kit**](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) | **Creator** | **23k+ Stars.** The standard-bearer for React boilerplates. Reduced setup time by ~70% for thousands of startups. |
| [**WS-Kit**](https://github.com/kriasoft/ws-kit) | **Author** | Type-safe WebSocket RPC framework. Ships real-time features faster and safer than hand-rolled sockets. |
| [**SyncGuard**](https://github.com/kriasoft/syncguard) | **Author** | Local-first synchronization for multi-client apps. Solves conflict logic so you don't have to. |

### 🛠 What I Do

I help founders and engineering leaders untangle complexity and ship faster.

* **SOLVE — AI-first MVPs & Distributed Systems**
    Design and ship RAG/agent pipelines with proper guardrails. I untangle legacy APIs and data models so your team can stop tiptoeing around them.

* **OWN — End-to-End Delivery**
    Scope → Architecture → Implementation → Infra. I build API platforms and data contracts teams can ship against, favoring simple, proven patterns over hype.

* **DE-RISK — Make it Maintainable**
    Align early, document decisions (ADRs/RFCs), and bake in CI/CD and telemetry. I leave behind clean handoffs that your team can maintain after I leave.

**What founders get when they hire me as a Fractional Principal / Lead:**

1.  **Clarity:** A clear problem brief, risk list, and prioritized backlog we align on immediately.
2.  **Architecture:** A concise design doc and a realistic delivery plan.
3.  **Production MVP:** A functional, observable system live in **4–8 weeks**.
4.  **Handoff:** CI/CD pipelines, preview envs, and ADRs so your team can take the reins.
