### Hi, I'm Konstantin Tarkus

Principal Software Engineer & Architect. I build AI-first MVPs and the boring-but-critical plumbing that keeps them alive in production — queues, webhooks, API gateways, and observability that doesn't wake you at 2am. Working from Porto San Giorgio, Italy since 2022; most mornings start with espresso and a paper notebook. [Let’s talk →](https://cal.com/koistya)

### What I Do

- **SOLVE — AI-first systems and distributed tech:** Design and ship AI-first MVPs, RAG/agent pipelines with schemas and guardrails, real-time/event-driven systems, and untangle legacy APIs/data models so teams can stop tiptoeing around them
- **OWN — End-to-end delivery:** Take scope → architecture → implementation → infra → observability, build API platforms and data contracts teams can ship against, ship weekly slices, favor simple/proven patterns, and use AI tools to compress delivery
- **DE-RISK — Make it maintainable:** Align early, communicate often, document decisions (ADRs/RFCs), bake in CI/CD, IaC, and telemetry, and leave clean handoffs teams can maintain after I leave

### What Founders Get in the First 30–90 Days

- **Clarity & scope:** A clear problem brief, prioritized backlog, risk list, and success metrics we’re aligned on
- **Architecture & plan:** A concise architecture doc and a realistic delivery plan the team can execute
- **MVP in production:** A functional MVP live in 4–8 weeks — production-ready, observable, and ready for early users
- **Ops & handoff:** CI/CD and preview environments in place, with ADRs and handoff docs so your team can move fast independently

### Testimonials

> "Konstantin is the steady technical hand every early-stage team hopes to find... avoids mountains of technical debt while keeping the team moving fast." — **Azad A.**, Head of Product

> "His specialty is infrastructure and architectural design... always up to date on bleeding-edge tech." — **Kavin P.**, Founder & COO

### Track Record

- **AI-driven property platform:** Rebuilt evaluation + CRM flow; cut agent prep time in half and increased conversion by tightening data quality and alerts.
- **Real-time co-sell dashboard:** Aggregated B2B pipelines and live partner signals; teams closed deals ~30% faster with shared visibility.

### Selected Open-Source Work

- [**React Starter Kit**](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) — full-stack SaaS template used by hundreds of teams, cutting MVP build time by ~70%
- [**WS-Kit**](https://github.com/kriasoft/ws-kit) — type-safe WebSocket RPC framework that ships real-time features faster and safer than hand-rolled sockets
- [**SyncGuard**](https://github.com/kriasoft/syncguard) — type-safe real-time sync for multi-client apps without writing conflict logic

### How I Work

- Prefer async communication (email/docs/tickets) over meetings; Linear beats Jira.
- Thrive in small, focused teams (1–5 engineers) and remote setups.
- Enjoy mentoring and code reviews; less excited about people management overhead.
- Obsess over code quality, testing, maintainability, plus clear UX.
- Early adopter who sticks to proven tools once they earn trust.
